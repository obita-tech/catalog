# Introduction 
 
Open Banking was first introduced to the world in Europe, primarily driven by the market regulation PSD2. In parallel, the Open Banking Implementation Entity (OBIE) was established in the UK, which set the Open Banking standard(s) for the country. This standard has since become the foundation upon which other jurisdictions have developed their own Open Banking frameworks.

On November 2nd, 2022, the Saudi Central Bank (SAMA) announced the release of the Open Banking Framework, a comprehensive set of legislation, regulatory guidelines, and technical standards based on international best practices. This framework is designed to facilitate open banking services for banks and fintechs in Saudi Arabia, with a focus on Account Information Services (AIS) in its first version. The imminent second version is currently in progress and will prioritize Payment Initiation Services (PIS). SAMA has set a timeline for all Saudi banks to go live with account data in the first quarter of 2023, with payment services targeted for later in the same year.
