API Profile: UK Account and Transaction API Profile - v3.1.10

Release Date: October 1st, 2022

Description: On October 1st, 2022, the UK's Open Banking Implementation Entity (OBIE) announced the release of the UK Account and Transaction API Profile - v3.1.10. This profile is designed to provide a standardized way for banks and financial institutions to offer open banking services, such as Account Information Services (AIS) and Payment Initiation Services (PIS).

The API profile is based on international best practices and is designed to ensure interoperability between different banks and financial institutions. It includes technical standards, guidelines, and specifications to ensure consistency and security in the exchange of data between parties.

All UK banks are required to implement the UK Account and Transaction API Profile - v3.1.10 as part of their compliance with the Payment Services Regulations 2017 (PSR). The PSR sets a timeline for all UK banks to go live with account data and payment services by March 31st, 2023.

This profile is expected to drive innovation and competition in the financial services industry, providing consumers with greater control over their financial data and enabling them to access a wider range of financial services.
