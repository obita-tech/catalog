# Introduction 
 
NextGenPSD2 Accounts API is a standardized set of technical specifications that enable financial institutions and third-party providers to access account information and payment initiation services. It is based on the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) regulations in the European Union, which mandate banks to provide access to customer data and payment initiation services to third-party providers through a standardized API.

The NextGenPSD2 Accounts API includes a comprehensive set of APIs that cover various aspects of account information and payment initiation services. These APIs enable account holders to securely share their account information with third-party providers and initiate payments from their accounts without the need for a card network.

The API includes resources for retrieving account balances, transaction history, and payment details, among others. It also defines a standard authentication and authorization process that ensures the secure and controlled sharing of customer data.

NextGenPSD2 Accounts API is designed to promote competition and innovation in the financial services industry by enabling new entrants to offer innovative financial products and services. It is also expected to provide customers with greater control over their financial data and enhance their ability to manage their finances.
